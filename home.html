                Worked in machine learning project focused on object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm.
                · Classify objects in real-time in images.
                · Successfully implemented the YOLO model, achieving high accuracy and efficiency in detecting multiple objects
                simultaneously.
                · This project enhanced my skills in communication ,team work and algorithmic understanding .
